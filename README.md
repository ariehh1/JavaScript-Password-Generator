# JavaScript-Password-Generator

For my third repository on Github, I have created a Javascript Password Generator.  This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.  The application combines the HTML, CSS, and now Javascript tools we have been covering in the Bootcamp.  The user will be prompted to choose from the following:

Length of password (must contain at least 8 characters but less than 128)

Character Type (user must select at least one):
Special characters
Numeric characters
Lowercase characters
Uppercase characters

The end result of the application provides the user a new and secure password.  Without a set of prompts, the user would not be able to follow any directions towards generating a new password.  

This repository cemented the concepts of Javascript and how logic plays a key role within software development.  By not confining a user within a set of boundaries and guidelines, the application would be open for interpretation and might not prompt the user towards a specific action or goal.
